## Abstract

Existing Distributed Hash Table (DHT) implementations verify data integrity by
comparing the received value with it's expected hash. This method only works in
cases where a hash of the data is known in advance, and a secure timestamp of
the data is not required.

Furthermore, there is no existing widespread standard for DHT, so each protocol
implements their own.

This paper explores the use of a single blockchain as a means of implementing a
secure DHT that is available for use by protocols simultaneously.

### Background

<div class="notes">
TODO 
(DHT) are commonly used in decentralised protocols to
acquire an unknown value.

"that require data integrity usually map the hash of each value to the value
itself. This way, a received value can be checked against it's key to ensure no
tampering has occured."

Talk about DHT, BitTorrent, PyBitMessage.

Talk about Blockchains, BitTorrent.
